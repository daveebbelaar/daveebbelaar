### Hey there 👋🏻

I'm Dave, an AI engineer with over a decade of experience in artificial intelligence. At [Datalumina](https://datalumina.com), I lead the AI projects, where we're always pushing the boundaries of what's possible while still building reliable applications.

I'm not going to impress you with theory, but teach you (without hype) how to build real AI systems, using [lasting engineering principles](https://www.youtube.com/@daveebbelaar?sub_confirmation=1).

Along the way:

- 10M+ views across YouTube, LinkedIn, and courses
- Helped 1M+ developers get started with AI
- Building and scaling a 7-figure AI company
- Delivered 50+ custom B2B AI solutions 
- Consulted for TimescaleDB, ClickUp, and n8n
- Helped 500+ developers launch freelance careers
- BSc + MSc in Artificial Intelligence (VU Amsterdam)

I post about AI engineering, building real systems, and what it takes to go independent as a developer.

If you want to build AI that actually works, or build a freelance career around it, start with my [ai-engineering-roadmap](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook/blob/main/roadmaps/ai-engineer-2026.md).
